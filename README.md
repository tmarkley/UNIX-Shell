UNIX-Shell

This project was done for my Operating Systems class at St. Olaf College

==========================================================================

This C program uses UNIX system calls to create a shell environment similar to /bin/sh or /bin/csh. This was a very
fun project that turned out quite well.

For some real fun, run it and type "hack"! Otherwise, almost all of the normal shell commands work!
